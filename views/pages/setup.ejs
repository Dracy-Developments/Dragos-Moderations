      Drago's Moderation and its website are still under heavy development. This

    <p>
      Howdy! If you are looking at this page, you have probably already added
      Drago's Moderation to your guild. If not, go to "home" and invite the bot
      to your server! This page will outline important information on how to get
      the bot set up.
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-primary">
      <h5>Need help setting up?</h5>
      If you would like the Drago's Moderations dev team to provide you a server
      template or help set up the bot in your guild (in the standard way),
      please join the support server from the left menu.

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Drago's Moderations needs the following permissions to work correctly. The
      bot invite button will assign these automatically.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <!-- TODO: Keep this updated -->
      <li>
        CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE [if you want the bot to generate invites
        automatically]

      <li>

        certain logs]
      </li>
      <li>
        READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY (for all channels) [Pruning, moderation, antispam /

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h5>Make Sure Roles are Correct!</h5>
      Not following this guide correctly could result in undesired behavior,
      such as trouble-makers not getting muted / restricted when they should.
    </div>
    <h3>Drago's Moderations (Bot) Role</h3>
    <p>
      When adding the bot to your guild, a role will be created for the bot
      containing necessary permissions. This role should be above all other
      roles (or at least, above everyone except your most trusted staff [such as
      admins]). It should also go above the mute role you create in the next
      section below.
    </p>
    <h3>Mute Role</h3>
    <p>
      You will want to create a mute role the bot can use to mute problematic
      users (especially for antispam). Ideally, the mute role should take away
      permissions to view any/all channels regular members can see, including
      info channels (to avoid the possibility they can DM spam when muted).
      However, simply taking away their ability to send messages in any channel
      will work well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mute role should ideally be above all other roles (except Drago's
      role), but you can alternatively put it above any roles you want capable
      of being muted.
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h5>Test your mute role!</h5>
      After making your mute role per this guide, test it out with a regular
      member to ensure it works as expected.
    </div>
    <h3>Verified Role</h3>
    <p>
      You will also need a verified role. This tells the bot, especially when it
      reboots, which members are new and which ones are not. You can also
      utilize a verified role to provide a "welcome gate" for your guild.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use the verified role to "welcome gate" new members, make sure all
      channels (except the most important info channels and maybe a "new member"
      channel) cannot be viewed, or at least posted in, by those without the
      verified role. If you completely remove view permissions from other
      channels, that helps prevent people from joining just to "mine" / "scrape"
      your guild of its content.
    </p>
    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h5>Test your verified role too!</h5>
      Make sure those without the role do not have unexpected access /
      privileges in your guild, unless you are not using it to "welcome gate"
      new members.
    </div>
    <h2>Incidents Category</h2>
    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h5>The bot does not use DMs!</h5>
      Remember that Drago's Moderations goes around the limitations of DMs by
      using private "incidents channels" to communicate with members.
    </div>
    <p>
      To begin, create a channel category.
      <strong
        >The default permissions for this category should be set such that only
        those you want to see all incidents channels will see them (such as
        staff).</strong
      >
      The bot will automatically manage other permissions as it creates
      channels.
